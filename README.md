Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game, a fun and challenging Python project where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The game offers different levels of difficulty, allowing players to choose how challenging they want their experience to be. It also provides useful hints after incorrect guesses, making the guessing process more interactive and engaging.

The game consists of three difficulty levels. In Level 1, the target number is between 1 and 10, making it a suitable choice for beginners. Level 2 increases the range from 1 to 100, providing a moderate challenge. Finally, in Level 3, the target number is between 1 and 1000, making it the most challenging option. Each level progressively tests the player's guessing abilities, ensuring that both new and experienced players can find an appropriate level of difficulty.

If you guess incorrectly, the game gives you one of four random hints to help guide your next guess. The hints include whether your guess was too high or too low, how far away you are from the correct number, the highest common factor (HCF) between your guess and the target number, or the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers. These hints add an educational and logical aspect to the game, helping players refine their guesses based on mathematical feedback.

Players begin the game with a score of 100, and every incorrect guess deducts 10 points. The objective is to guess the correct number before your score reaches zero. If you successfully guess the number, the game displays a congratulatory message along with your remaining score. However, if your score drops to zero before you find the correct number, you lose the game and are encouraged to try again.

To play the game, simply run the Python script and select your preferred difficulty level. After choosing a level, start entering your guesses. With each incorrect guess, the game will provide one of the four hints mentioned earlier, helping you get closer to the correct answer. Keep guessing until you either guess the number correctly or run out of points.

This game requires Python 3.x and makes use of Python's built-in random module. To get started, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, and run the script using Python. The game is lightweight, easy to run, and provides an enjoyable challenge for anyone interested in logic games.

In the future, the game could be expanded to include more advanced features. One potential improvement is the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction. Another possibility is introducing a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other to guess the correct number faster. Adding a timer could also increase the game's difficulty by creating a race against the clock.
